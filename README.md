# Bookmarks

## Outline
---
This project will highlight databse and UI knowledge.
In this project we will build a bookmark manager web application.

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.
